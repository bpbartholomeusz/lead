Session Booking is a [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) plugin that allows Aviation Training Organizations (ATO) manage instructor-led training sessions. It allows students to post their availability and instructors to book sessions according to student availability.

Session Booking provides a workflow for posting availability slots, booking against these slots, then grading the exercise. The plugin also allows course managers in assigning students to instructors.
